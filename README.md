# My-first-polygon-token
My first blockchain experiment: creating and configuring an ERC‚Äë20 token on Polygon using MetaMask, Remix, and TokenTool. Documenting my journey of learning tokenomics, exploring no‚Äëcode token creation, and pausing deployment due to insufficient MATIC funds.
Date & Time of Project:** July 30, 2025, 10:00 AM ‚Äì 11:45 AM IST

This repository documents my journey of exploring blockchain by creating my **first cryptocurrency token on Polygon (MATIC)**.

## üöÄ What I Did

1. Learned about **ERC-20 tokens and Polygon network**
2. Set up **MetaMask**, added **Polygon Mainnet & Testnet**
3. Experimented with **testnet faucets**
4. Tried **Remix IDE** deployment (faced Amoy testnet auto-connect issue)
5. Explored **TokenTool (Bitbond)** for no-code token creation
6. Configured:
   - Token Name: Kevin Coin
   - Symbol: KEV
   - Supply: 1,000,000
   - Advanced features: Burnable, Mintable, Supply Cap
7. Paused deployment due to **insufficient MATIC funds**

## üí° What I Learned

- Basics of **tokenomics**: supply cap, burn fee, holder rewards
- **How MetaMask interacts** with dApps and testnets
- **Practical deployment steps** for Polygon tokens
- **Importance of gas fees**, even for small experiments

## üôè Acknowledgment

- I used **ChatGPT** as my **mentor and guide** during the entire process
- This was a **personal learning project**, not for commercial or investment purposes

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Current Status

- Token not deployed yet due to insufficient MATIC
- Next step: **Add MATIC funds and deploy to Polygon Mainnet**
- Future plan: **Add liquidity on QuickSwap** and explore DEX trading

This repository serves as a **log of my first blockchain experiment** and will be updated once I deploy the token and complete the journey.
